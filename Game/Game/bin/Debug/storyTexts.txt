He grew up in a small city in the western desert.
His family owned some land on the northern part of the desert next to some mountains and a river.
When he was around 8 years old his parents and his sister were killed by a monster while they were traveling in a carriage.
He stayed at home, so he became the last person in the family.
After hearing the news of his parents’ death his distant relatives all went there to get the land.
He couldn't do anything, and he was kicked out.
He could only sneak out a few of the items that his father owned, which included their family heirloom, a dagger, clothes and some food.
He started to train to get stronger.
He lived on the streets or stayed in the mountains.
He could only eat food that he got for free or some small animals thet he caught.
